			<p class="newSect">The beasts, they lurk...</p>
				<p>The village of Buruus has been fighting for survival since it was established 
					against the dangerous plants and beasts that lurk. It's been three hundred years 
					since <a href="storyMyrosyAft.asp">The Darkening</a>, and though life is tough 
					it appears that they've got a good system in place. 
				</p>
				<p>However, recently there's been a rise in the number of beasts lurking around 
					and there are a new type slinking about in the woods. Though new species of 
					beasts being spotted isn't rare around Buruus, the fact that they seemed to show 
					up in such a great number is worrying. A number of people have been killed, the 
					exact creature responsible unknown, and the village is on edge.
				</p>
				<p>Elisa, one of the villagers from Buruus, discovers a small nest of these creatures.
				 She carefully watches them, reporting their activities to Penn, the village elder. 
				 Upon being told, he draw parallels between the creatures and the once-revered Solaeris 
				 that were worshipped in Myrosy. 
				</p>
				<p>These troubling signs, amongst other strange sightings and happeneings, prompt elder 
					Penn to send a party in the direction of the ruined city in hopes of answers. Elisa, 
					having discovered and learneda bout these creatures tags along, never once suspecting 
					that she had triggered an important series of events.
