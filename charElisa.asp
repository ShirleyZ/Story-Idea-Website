        <p><b>Biography</b></p>
        <p>Loud and unruly since a child, Elisa's a very nimble and quick gatherer. She often climbs trees and ledges to reach the highest or the biggest glowing fungi as a challenge and a way of keeping things interseting. This has resulted in her fair share of bumps and broken bones, which she's wisened up from, but also a fair amount of scoldings from Elder Penn. As a result, Elisa has a funny habit of disappearing whenever Elder Penn is around.</p>
        <p>Elsia looks up to Jenn like an elder sister, and this is especially true after Jenn had saved her life. Elisa had wandered away from the group during one of her rounds, over-confident and under-prepared for the dangers that everyone had been warned about. She had realised too late that she had wandered into the terrain of a Great Pit, slowly slipping down as she futilely scrabbled to climb out. If it wasn't for Jenn hearing her cries of distress and lowering rope to her, that would have been the end of Elisa. Needless to say, she's taken warnings much more seriously since that incident and shudders to think of it.
