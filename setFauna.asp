        <p>The Dead Forest is home to many dangerous beasts, few having developed no defenses or survival mechanisms against the harsh environment. Many animals rely on greater light sensitivity and night vision, those who do not instead value other senses over sight. 
        </p>
        <p>Most beasts are carnivorous, or at elast omivorous, as plants are a relatively scarce food cource and often cannot sustain a species for long. What beasts do have a plant-only diet often expend very little energy or are in a relationship with the plant.
        </p>
        <p>The competitive environment for food makes it difficult and dangerous for the villagers or Buruus to venture out alone and as a result most are trained in at least basic combat and survival. Unless a villager is a hunter and learned in the ways of the beasts, most are told to avoid and escape in the case of an encounter.
        </p>
        <p>The Fauna of the Dead Forest are an important source of food and materials for the villagers, alongside their plant diet. In addition to eating the meat, bones and horns can be fashioned into weapons or tools, and hides used in tailoring bags and clothes.

        <p>Due to the dark nature of the environment, many beasts have developed their own form of bioluminescence. Some use these lights as a method of luring their prey into a trap and can be used to either resemble the plants and mushrooms that are common sources of food, or to imitate weaker prey. 
        </p>
        <p>Most beasts in the Dead Forest are darkly hued and rarely colourful, though even if they were it'd be almost impossible to tell. The dark already helps hide them, the beasts further rely on casting silhouettes that look like trees or inocuous things.
        </p>
        <p>Beasts can be loosely categorised into three groups: Hunters, Protectors and Gatherers.
        </p>
      <p class="newSect">Hunters</p>
        <p>Most hunter type beasts rely on their keen sense of vision to find and hunt prey.
          Their bodies usually allow for swift and silent movement through the forest to 
          catch their prey unawares. Hunters can come large or small, with the smaller 
          hunters usually working in packs to take down prey. 
        </p>
        <p>Some hunters rely on prey wandering into their traps over actively seeking them 
        	out. These are the types of beasts that make use of camoflauge the most and usually
        	have claws or jaws that can snap up prey very fast.
        </p>
      <p class="newSect">Protectors</p>
        <img class="inTextImg right" src="Images/fauna.jpg"
        	alt="A boar with large tusks that it uses to defend the plant and mushrooms behind it"
        	title="A boar with large tusks that it uses to defend the plant and mushrooms behind it">
        <p>Protectors are types of beasts whose lives revolve around a symbiotic relationship
        	with a plant, or some other life-giving source of light or food. In the case of 
        	functioning alongside plants, protectors ensure the plant can successfully spread 
        	its seeds and won't get demolished by other, less gentle beasts in return for a 
        	steady source of food.
        </p>
        <p>There are many types of protectors which live in colonies to maintain a system of 
        	plants although a one to three beasts protecting one large plant isn't rare to come across.
        	The people of Buruus usually get by these protectors by tracking their movements to
        	discover what times and routines the beasts have, before slipping in to quickly pick
        	and harvest the plant. Finding a protector can also indicate that there are food sources
        	nearby to gatherers, or that there are more beasts around to hunters.
        </p>
      <p class="newSect">Gatherers</p>
        <p>Gatherers are beasts who focuses on collecting, or stealing, food from other
        	beasts, including the villagers. Usually small, quick and nimble, they're a 
        	big problem for the villagers if more than a few decide to target their stocks.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the less harmless gatherers may make use of light paralytic poison or scents
        	that drive beasts away to aid their theft of food or as a form of escape should they be
        	caught in the act. These scents and poisons can be very useful to Buruus, and so hunters
        	often trap and harvest them. The scents can be used as an escape and the poisons are often
        	used to tip arrows or spears to better down game or assist escape.
        </p>
        <p>Gatherers that don't rely on the tactics often rely on their agility and dexterity to 
        	gather food and escape predators. Some of the hunters suspect that some have come to a
        	 mutual understanding with protectors, and are able to exchange services or resources for a
        	 share from the food sourrce.
