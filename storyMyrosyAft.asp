			<p class="newSect">The Darkening and fall</p>
				<p>The Darkening happened upon the people of Myrosy with seemingly no warning. 
					Those who were working around dawn and usually saw the golden streaks which 
					signalled the rising of the sun would have noticed the rays suddenly being snuffed 
					out if they had paid attention. Initially people remarked how strange it was that 
					the sun rose late, but as the day wore on it became apparant that the sun was 
					nowhere to be seen. 
				</p>
				<p>Unease spread through the masses as the morning wore on, and many fell to panic 
					around what would have been late morning. Local Temples were filled with worried and 
					panicked faces, demanding answers that the Divine Officials didn't have. The city-centre 
					remained silent for what felt like an age to many, and the first official announcement, to stay 
					calm, did little to ward away their fears.
				</p>
				<p>Eventually news spread that all the Solaeris had gone. Those that usually resided in Main 
					Temples left empty, cold rooms and not a single wild Solaeris was seen in sight. Furthermore, 
					all members of the Higher Council had similarly disappeared, leaving no trace. Those that didn't 
					succumb to panic and riots huddled in fear at home, wondering what this meant.
				</p>
				<p>Although the shock was great, the military and temples stepped in in place of the Higher 
					Council, who would normally lead during times of distress, and convinced many to go on with their 
					normal day. After all, they still had a stock of solar cells with which to power the city. This enabled 
					them to go through their usualy daily routines, though not without great unease.
				</p>
				<p>The mystery surrounding the cause of this was never found, with efforts diverted to 
					keeping a panicking city intact. Despite the best efforts of the remaining councillers, 
					riots broke out and looting forced paranoia upon everyone. The city of Myrosy crumbled 
					more and more every day until it had been abandoned completely.
				</p>
			<p class="newSect">Surviving a new environment</p>
				<p>Those who fled the city found themselves up against so many things they didn't know 
					how to deal with. It was cold, dark and full of predators who were better suited to night 
					than they and many died within the first few days of fleeing. The people who did manage to 
					survive the first few weeks eventually found each other, forming small communities and 
					sharing tips on survival. These were the beginnings of villages such as Buruus. 
				</p>
				<p>The power cells which some had packed were running low, and as the days wore on and the 
					realisation finally sunk in, the lost people realised they had to re-invent how to survive. 
					Those who worked under the military and had knowledge on some of the beasts quickly tried to 
					teach and invent new ways to manage them. The old cell-powered guns which shot tranquilisers were 
					of no use to them now with solar cells becoming a precious commodity. 
				</p>
				<p>In addition to the threat of cold and wild beasts, the lost people of Myrosy found that plants that 
					once thrived began to die from the lack of sun, and it wasn't uncommon for people to drop dead from 
					hunger. It was an incredibly hard period of time for the lost people, and it took a great many lives 
					through trial and error before some communities were able to establish new sources of food.
				</p>
			<p class="newSect">The Lost People, now</p>
				<p>Centuries passed with the lost people struggling to survive. Larger communities formed 
					and eventually towns and villages began popping up. When communities found each other, 
					they were overjoyed and usually celebrated by a small festival. Stories of the days of old 
					would be shared by the elders as the children, who have never seen people outside their own town,
					 curiously inspect one another. Though the people devised ways to manage and survive, 
					 living in these villages never ceased to be a struggle.
				</p>
				<p>The village of Buruus was one of the villages in a network of three, however recently 
					contact with the other two have been lost since the number of beasts seems to have 
					risen and Elder Penn deemed it too dangerous to venture out more than a day's journey 
					for the time being.
