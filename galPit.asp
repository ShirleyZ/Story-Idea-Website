        	<p>Great Pits are carnivorous plants that lure prey in with a soft glow and 
        		enticing smells. It's easy to fall victim to as inexperienced people and 
        		beasts can be hypnotised by the plant in the middle if they're not careful.
        	</p>
        	<p>The pit that the plant creates is made up of vines which are sensitive to 
        		movement. They secrete a sticky liquid that prevents fallen beasts to escape 
        		and eventually they sink into the vines which hide the digestive system of 
        		the plant.
        	</p>
        	<p>The spikes surrounding the flowering part of the plant are filled with a 
        		paralytic venom that immobilises prey to make it easier to consume. They also 
        		serve to protect the flowers from large animals which could destroy it. 
        	</p>
        	<p>Removal of large established Great Pits are impossible for the villagers of 
        		Buruus, and so hunters and gatherers are always on the lookout for a Great Pit 
        		sprout which are easy to remove. Harvesting Great Pit sprouts provide berries, leaves 
        		and small doses of the paralytics venom that the plant produces.
