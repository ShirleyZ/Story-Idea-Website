				<p>Buruus is the village that Elisa lives in and is situated in the Dead Forests. 
					It is a small village that was fairly well off until the recent rise in predators 
					in the woods which lead to the loss of ten people. Now the numbers are down to 
					around a hundred.
				</p>
				<p>The village focuses on gathering and hunting as its means of survival. Food is 
					usually preserved and carefully stored for any unexpected hard seasons and everyone 
					in the village is aware of the dangers that lies at the gates. A significant number 
					of the villagers are either hunters or gatherers, with the rest crafting and refining 
					the resources that are brought back or cooking and managing the day-to-day affairs of 
					the village.
				</p>
				<p>There is no system of currency in place in the village, and everyone works towards 
					their combined survival. It's common knowledge amongst the village that they need every 
					able body they can get to improve their chances of survival and as a result things 
					are mostly equal, if hard at times. Goods and materials are handed out on a basis of 
					if someone needs it or not. Every hunter and gatherer are given their own weapons with 
					care kits and told to carefully look after them. 
				</p>
			<p class="newSect">Training and Education</p>
				<p>Children are sent off to the village nursery when they reach the age of three at which 
					point the parents shift from taking care of their children full-time to jobs within the 
					village such as crafting or cooking. When children reach the age of five, parents often 
					return to their initial roles of hunting or gathering if that is what they used to be. 
				</p>
				<p>There are usually one or two guardians assigned to children who teach them about the ways 
					of the village as well as the dangers that lie beyond. Basic maths and writing lessons also 
					begin during their time with the guardians. Practical skills that help survival and important 
					lessons and warnings are also given at this time and readies the child for a dangerous environment.
				</p>
				<p>Children are often sent on errands within the village when they reach the age 
					of eight. More and more responsibilities are given to them as they age until they 
					specialise into a role at the age of fourteen. These roles are chosen by the child 
					who usually shows an interest in it a few years before.
				</p>
				<p>At fourteen, they can choose a profession and are usually mentored by someone from that 
					profession. It's not uncommon for children to follow in the same footsteps and one of their 
					parents and for their parent to mentor the child. This apprenticeship goes on for two years where 
					they learn the ropes. They are then assigned to groups to work together with before taking a 
					 test at the age of eighteen which marks them as an adult.
				</p>
			<p class="newSect">Festivals</p>
				<p>Some notable occasions for celebration include the birth of a child and annual 
					festivals which recognise those who have specialised into roles or passed into 
					adulthood. These festivals usually include more food than usual, and hunters and 
					gatherers may go out of their way to find more food for the occasion. Carefully 
					stored rations of rare or delicious food may be dipped into to celebrate and reward 
					those the celebrations honour.
				</p>
				<p>While birthdays are noted, they aren't cause for celebration because the village 
					simply doesn't have enough resources for how frequent they are. Instead children are 
					given a new toy, tool and/or clothes and adults may work a shorter day on top of 
					receiving gifts. Despite the habit of being given gifts, it often isn't expected of 
					others.
