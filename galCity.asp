        	<p>Myrosy is composed of a centre ring where the Councillers live and work from 
        		with an announcement area held just outside the gates that seperate them. The 
        		rest of the city is seperated into rings, which categoris wealth and importance, 
        		and quarters, which determine industry and work type.
        	</p>
        	<p>The city is composed of three outer rings and the centre circle. The rings are 
        		named according to the stages of the sun. They are named Rise, Bloom, Set and Dawn 
        		organised from inside to out. The quarters of the city can be recognised according 
        		to the colours associated with them that range from orange to brown. 
        	</p>
        	<p>Each quarter of the city is associated with one area that they excel in, though 
        		other buildings are present. In the tan quarter, there are many buildings that 
        		belong to the trade guilds and often contain market stalls and inns that accomodate 
        		traders from villages and other parts of the city. It's a busy, bustling area which 
        		falls under the jurisdiction of the Trade and Resources Councillers.
        	</p>
        	<p>The beige quarter is associated with education and training with lots of housing and 
        		learning institutions. It is located right beside the tan quarter as many students 
        		run between the two quarters to complete their studies and training. The orange quarter 
        		houses the Main Temple and a section of it serves as training grounds for the Acolytes.
        		The military and bookkeeping workers reside in the brown quarter.
