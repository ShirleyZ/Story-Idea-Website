  			Myrosy, A city of Sun

			<p class="newSect">General</p>
				<p>The city of Myrosy was a prosperous and thriving city that centred around the 
				sun. It was well known for it's advanced technology on top of it's golden city, 
				which gleamed bright and high upon the mountains where it was situated. Myrosy 
				boasted a population of over five million, with a majority living in the city itself.
				 Myrosy had a network of treetop towns sprawled around it from which resources and 
				 materials were traded to and from.

					alt="A Diagram of The Eleven" title="A Diagram of The Eleven">
				<p>The city of Myrosy was lead by a council of eleven. Each of The Eleven had their 
					own affairs to manage and report back to the council during the monthly Council 
					Meetings. Amongst The Eleven, there are five Higher Councillers who manage Well-being, 
					Technology, Trade, Treasury and Resources. The six Lesser Councillers manage Military, 
					Temples, Events, Education, Public Advisors, Bookkeeping. 
				</p>
				<p>There are many trade guilds throughout Myrosy, and liasons are appointed by each 
					guild to manage good relations with the Councillers and other trade guilds. The 
					majority of city-dwellers in Myrosy work within on of the guilds, and they often work 
					closely with the Events and Infrastructure Councillers.
				</p>
				<p>Myrosy doesn't have very many neighbours, and as a result is very isolated. Most
				 of the people of Myrosy have never known or encountered anything different from home 
				 and only scouters, when they're sent out, ever leave the city and its connected towns. 
				 As there are no warring neighbours, Myrosy's military is dedicated towards the protection
				 of its citizens from the dangerous animals lurking below the treetops and to keep peace 
				 in the city and towns in the case of disagreements. 
				</p>
			<p class="newSect">Technology</p>
				<p>Myrosy was very technologically advanced with most of its technologies relying on 
					solar power, viewing the sun as an ever-generous and never-ending source of energy 
					and life. While most things in the city power themselves during the day, they are also 
					equipped with a solar cell which is capable of lasting weeks without sun. These solar cells 
					are an important staple within Myrosy and it's common for people to be paid in part 
					with a number of these solar cells. Cells are distributed from the Resources Counciller who 
					collects empty cells to be recharged. 
				</p>
				<p>Transport within the city is managed by a system of trams and deducts a certain number 
					of charges from a solar cell or requires a purchased ticket to board. The system works 
					in rings that circle the city-centre and lines which brings trams straight to or from the 
					city-centre. For those travelling short distances, small shuttles can move people around within 
					the same district. There are also animals available to be bought and ridden, though these are 
					usually luxuries or for companionship over an established norm.
				</p>

			<p class="newSect">Religion and Customs</p>
        <img class="inTextImg right" src="Images/storyBef2.jpg" alt="A Picture of the Solaeris" title="A picture of the Solaeris">
				<p>Religious worship within Myrosy usually consists of making personal tributes to the Sun 
					Mother at Temples weekly. Events are also held bi-monthly by the Councillers to thank and 
					pay respects to the Sun Mother. These are large, city-wide festivals and can range from 
					processions lead by the Divine Officials to large feasts being held and gifts given out 
					at Temples.
				</p>
				<p>It is believed that while the Sun Mother watches over all, she has sent her children, the Solaeris, to 
					help the people of Myrosy. These creatures are large golden and fiery with wings that shine like gold. 
					They're bird-like, with long slender necks and trailing trails that gleam in the sky. 
					There are many living wild among the mountains that Myrosy resides on, but there are a 
					few living within the Main Temples of the Sun Mother being cared for by the Divine Officials.
				</p>
				<p>Representatives of the Temples are Divine Officials who are marked by their dress and 
					appearance. Yellow and Red are the two colours which are associated with and reserved for 
					Divine Officials. Their <a href="galOfficial.asp">uniforms</a> is covered in sun motifs, and are composed of a headband, 
					a long vest, flowing shorts and numerous gold decorations fashioned in the likeness of the sun.
				</p>
				<p>To become a Divine Official, one is first drafted to become an Acolyte at the job tests. 
					It is then a long journey in studies of lore and teachings of the Temples as well as 
					multiple tests assessing the acolyte's personal enlightenment. Acolytes have the option of 
					re-trying for these tests, but they are also permitted to re-take the jobs test to be sorted 
					into another area of work. After a minimum of five years, Acolytes attend an Enlightenment ceremony 
					in which they are recognised as Divine Officials.
