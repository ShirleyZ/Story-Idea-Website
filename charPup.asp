        <p><b>Biography</b></p>
        <p>Pup is one of the many creatures that are native to the forest that Elisa lives in. Very little is known about Pup and how it works or lives, only that it eats meat and seems more than happy to tag along.
        </p>
        <p>Pup is actually small and a runt of its kind and was found wounded on one of Elisa's rounds through the forest. Rather than killing it, Elisa sneaked it back into the village where she fed and nursed it back to health.
        </p>
        <p>The first time Pup made its presence known was during a village celebration. Jenn, one of the village hunters, had felled one of the beasts in the night, which signalled the end of almost a month of scarce rations for the village. Pup had bolted towards the food to the shock and screams of the villagers. Had Elisa not jumped on it before Jenn speared it, Pup would have been stew that night.
        </p>
        <p>Nowadays the villagers have gotten used to it being around, some warming up to Pup more than others. If it's lucky, hanging around the right people means an extra morsel or two in a day.
        </p>
        <p>Pup and Elisa are usually inseperable. It follows Elisa around and helps her find useful plants that she's missed.</p>
