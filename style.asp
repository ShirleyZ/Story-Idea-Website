        	<p class="title">Layout</p>
            <p>
            	The layout of this website feature content in the centre of the page with panels depicting the setting on either side. It's meant to feel more open compared to my previous websites which were all very small and fit in the browser without scrolling. 
            </p>            
            <p>
            	Resizing the browser will reveal that I've tried to make this website viewable in a few different resolutions. It doesn't work too well when it gets thinner than 660px, but I feel like above 660px is a reasonable size for desktop viewing. The images that I use resize according to the width of the browser as well as the contents area.
            </p>
            <p>
            	I've also tried to make it feel more immersive and used images that depict settings from the story in the layout. However, they're off to the side so it isn't the centre of attention because the focus should be on the content.
            </p>
        	<p class="title">Navigation</p>
            <p>
            	I've used a navigation bar at the bottom of the page which I feel is an accessible place but not the main focus of attention. It's also clean and uncluttered, making it easy for the user to find. The main links glow green to tie into the overall theme of the website and the story.
            </p>
        	<p class="title">Colours</p>
            <p>
            	The colours used on this website were chosen to tie in with the theme of darkness and scarce light that's shown in the story. More explanation for colour choice can be found <a href="reflection.asp">here</a>
            </p>
