        	<p>Following the great darkening, many of Nyjalda's plants died and the few that survived struggled to find a new source of food and nourishment. In the years that followed, plants either grew to be lumiscent themselves, to form a relationship with things that did, or turn to meat for their alternative source of food. 
            </p>
            <p>There are still leafy plants growing within The Dead Forest, but far less than there once was. Mushrooms and fungi now flourish in this dark environment, having already had a head start before the great darkening. They can be found littered amongst the woods.
            </p>
            <p>Lifeless trunks make up the base of the forest, a reminder of the past that's yet to completely disappear. Plants with a thick wooden trunk are rare now, most becoming thin and slender. However, wood-like materials can be found in some of the larger, tougher fungus or the numerous vines that stretch throughout the forest.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the categories used to label and differentiate plants are whether they flower, whether they are luminescent and whether they are carnivorus or not.

            <p>Some of the plants in The Dead Forest provide fruits and berries that often glow or are extremely sweet smelling. These types of plants usually aim to survive by being spread across a large area of land by the animals that eat their fruits and berries. As a result of this, they are commonly found in spots all over the forest and don't have much danger associated with the plants themselves. The danger for gatherer's lies in the fact that many other creatures may be drawn to the same berries.
            </p>
            <p>For other plants, their edible parts may be found in leaves, roots or stems. These plants have typically evolved with defenses such as spikes or poisons to ward off unwelcome visitors. When the gatherers harvest form these types of plants, the spikes and poisons are usually also harvested and used back in the village. Spikes can be turned into useful tools such as needles and pins while poisons can be used to tip weapons or traps.
            </p>
        	<p class="newSect">Predatory plants</p>
            <p>Many plants have turned to meat for their source of food and can grow much larger in size than non-predatory plants. Some can cover ground up to 10 metres away from the central segment of the plant. They are usually avoided by gatherers and and noted by the village. These plants have a relationship with the people of Buruus in that they keep the number of dangerous predators down, but are competing with them for food. This results in hunting groups sent out now and then to eliminate some plants if the balance is thrown out.

            <p>Some plants rely on ensnaring or trapping their prey through vines or slippery slopes while others lure them in with similar scents to berries and fruits. One of the first things taught to trainee gatherer's is how to tell the difference between a harmless berry bush and the trap of a predatory plant. Signs that they're told to watch out for are usually the feel of the forest floor and the sounds in the air. 
            </p>
            <p>Another method that some predatory plants employ involve poisons or paralysing needles. Once something falls victim to the plant, its body is slowly pulled into the plant's hidden maw.
