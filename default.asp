            	This site houses the ideas and information on <em>Into the Dark</em>, an original work in progress story concept by Shirley Zhang. 
            </p>
            
        	<p><em>Into the Dark</em> is set in the fantasy land of Nyjalda, a land that's been plunged into darkness for over three hundred years. The people of Myrosy, once a shining sun-based civilisation, now struggle to survive in this new environment.
            </p>
        	<p>The story follows the adventures of Elisa, a young girl born to one of the many small villages that are trying to hold their own. Having never known anything brighter than the moon, Elisa is a simple girl who just wants to help everyone survive.  However an unexpected series of events puts her on the path of discovering the truth of it all.
            </p>
          	
            <p>It's only as she draws nearer to the truth, that she begins to realise that some things are best left to the dark.</p>
