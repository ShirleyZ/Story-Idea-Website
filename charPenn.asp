        <p><b>Biography</b></p>
        <p>An excellent crafter and decent hunter back in his days, Elder Penn is now 
        	known for extra-long lectures and penchant for spicy food. Years of experience 
        	help him advise the village and warn the people about things such as keeping the 
        	predators and plants in balance as well as what dangers to watch out for. 
				</p>
				<p>He still helps out with the crafting and weaving that turns raw resources into 
					useful bags and equipment and spends most of his days that way. Occasionally he 
					also is called upon to deal with unruly children. Penn enjoys subjecting them to 
					extra long lectures in an attempt to bore them out of breaking rules. Children 
					learn to avoid him and his lectures, but find as they grow up that useful and 
					important advice can be given unexpectedly from him.
				</p>
