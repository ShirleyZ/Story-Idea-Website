        <p><b>Biography</b></p>
        <p>Quiet and usually serious, Jenn excels at hunting and is well known in the village for it. Though she does her job well, she's more awkward when it comes to talking to and managing people, children especially, and is only recently coming to terms with the greater responsibilities that the village has put upon her after the death of their previous Head Hunter.</p>
        <p>She enjoys spending time alone, often going off to check her traps of taking care of her hunter's kit and can usually be found in her hut or a small corner of the village dining area.
